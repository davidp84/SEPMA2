**Ticket Status**
When tickets are created by staff they are automatically given the status of open. If a technician logs into the program they can follow steps to changing the status from open to resolved, unresolved or closed.

A technician, once logged in, will be met by options that they can choose from. Option 3 is 'Edit Ticket Status'. Following this the tech will be asked for the ticket ID number which they wish to edit. If the tech enters an invalid option they will be notified and returned to the main options display. If a valid ticket is chosen then the tech will be able to choose the new status of the ticket. If an incorrect status is chosen then the tech will be notified and returned to the main display. If a correct status is chosen then the status will be changed in the system and a message will be displayed showing these changes.
